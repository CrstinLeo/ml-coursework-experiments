# set the hyperparameters

# Calculate mean and variance of all genes

# Select 100 genes (two methods)

# Calculate the covariance matrix of the selcted genes and the precision matrix

# Initiate a graph
# You can read more about networkx here:
# https://networkx.org/

graph=nx.Graph()

# Add edges to the graph by your precision matrix
# Use command graph.add_edge():
# https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.Graph.add_edge.html

# draw your graph:
nx.draw(graph)
